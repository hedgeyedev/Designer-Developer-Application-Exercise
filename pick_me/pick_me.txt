I really enjoy what I do. 

I love web development and all the pieces that translate a static
PSD into an interactive responsive piece of the internet. And I'm
good at it. 

I'll be happy to demonstrate why by sharing some examples from my
development experience while making this demo site:

First off, I am not a designer. You'll notice I did not create 
mockups for a mobile design. However, I have a lot of experience
creating responsive websites and by looking at the desktop design
I knew how I wanted it to behave on mobile. I chose a fluid responsive
layout that would look good on mobile but also on every screen size in
between. All my font sizes are relative so that they show at an
appropriate size for the screen. The quote and bio images always
appear on the top on mobile for consistency instead of alternating
as they do on desktop. 

On the other hand, I do have basic knowledge of photoshop. I'm a
big believer in doing as much with CSS as possible and there were
a few times I had to edit the provided assets (I included my edited
assets in the design/finished_assets folder). The first case was
with the conference logos: the PNG files had white space built into 
the image and I prefer to do that with padding so as to have better
control and have it be as flexible as possible. The other case was with the
headshots. When I was going to use them, they had a white distortion
around the border which is a result of how it was exported/saved.
I went into the PSD, got the full square image, saved it and made
the circle effect myself using border-radius. Of course I also 
relied heavily on the PSD to get font sizes, font weights and spacing.

I consider myself a good problem solver who also likes to take
initiative. While making this project I thought of a few features
that were not requested but which would be reasonable additions.
The first one I did implement which is the addition of a favicon.
It's easy to overlook and not strictly necessary but I think it
helps make the page unique and also offers additional branding. 
In this case I used the H from the Hedgeye logo. The other addition
I considered was to build the quotes/testimonials section to support 
multiple quotes. I didn't want to stray too far from the specs so 
I didn't implement it but ideally I would have a section where if
there were multiple quotes there would be a carousel that would 
be navigable and show one at a time. If there is only one quote,
it would still be a carousel but with no visible controls and not
navigable. All controls would be responsive of course. 

I have a good founation but I'm always interested in learning more.

I can definitely write/talk a lot about myself and my work. I hope 
you take it as further evidence of how dedicated I am to best 
practices and quality and how proud I am of my work. 


Speaking of which, here are some projects I have done Front End for
that are currently live:

1. Nautica Watches: (http://nauticawatches.com)
	Task: Create a WordPress website that features the Nautica brand 
	of watches and which provides additional information not found
	on the Nautica site where they can be purchased.

2. Valparaiso Law (http://valpo.edu/law)
	Task: Reskin the existing Valparaiso Law School WordPress website.

3. Felicity House: (http://felicity-house.org)
	Task: Create a website and blog using WordPress for this 
	non-clinical program in New York that supports women with autism. 

4. iMortgage: (http://imortgage.com)
	Task: Reskin existing site; delivered front end code for 
	iMortgage team to integrate.

5. Logitech
	Task: Create a series of landing pages and email blasts for web 
	conferencing product, integrating code and assets into existing 
	Marketo platform. Development environment must be flexible enough 
	to support the creation and maintenance of variations of the
	landing page for different countries/languages.

And in case you were curious, I use Sublime Text and especially the Emmet
package which saves me a lot of typing using selector-like commands. 

ex. 
ul>(li>a{Item $})*3

becomes:

<ul>
	<li><a href="">Item 1</a></li>
	<li><a href="">Item 2</a></li>
	<li><a href="">Item 3</a></li>
</ul>

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Mireille Gallegos
