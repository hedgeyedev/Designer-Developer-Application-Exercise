Hedgeye you should choose me to join your Development team because I have the potential to be your next rockstar developer. I have a ton to offer already from my years of professional experience, whether that’s just being a solid and efficient coder or someone who can offer relevant creative and business suggestions. I have a well-rounded skill-set that most narrow-minded developers don’t have. I’m a super fast learner and even without proper motivation I have the kind of ‘no giving up’ attitude that often allows me to crush any limiting barriers and succeed. I’m always hungry to learn more and with guidance from your senior staff I know I can bring us both to the next level of productivity.

That being said I am not the usual type of head-down geeky coder with no personality. I have experience working with clients and being in a work environment where my charisma can also be a factor that helps ease work flow and separates me from the rest.


Thanks you for your consideration.
