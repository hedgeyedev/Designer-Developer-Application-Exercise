Hello Hedgeye!

I'm super excited for the opportunity to tell you about why I would be a great
choice for your team. With over three years of experience developing on both the front
end and backend for a wide range of clients I have the skill and passion to add
real value to Hedgeyes team. I am a self taught developer, so staying on the edge of
technology and continuous learning have become a part of my tool-belt.

Beyond my programing knowledge I believe I have very strong interpersonal skills.
I am a great communicator and work very well with others. I am a self motivated go
getter with a love for development, music and people. Hedgeye seem's like a great fit,
and I would love to talk in person to tell you more about me and hear more about the work
that you are doing!

Thank you for your consideration.

-Alex Handler
